# HackHarvard2018V2
A project made by Fuad Youssef and Jude Rosen for Hack Harvard 2018
It is intended to have a new user input their contact information, which is then saved to a text file. The user will then get to add more data to this later.
After inputting the information, the user will then get the opportunity to share this information as a QR code or via NFC to another user of the app.
The app will come with a QR code reader as well as the ability to recieve data via NFC in order to add new contacts.
